This project contains the basic utilities for doing sequence analyssis. 
This is a mini version of orparapp and only contains C++ source codes.

do ./configure
make
make install
should be sufficient.

If any dependency is needed install the dependency:

  1. Orpara
  2. Bamtools (I branched the original project and added some
    interface functions)

Both are from my git hub page.
