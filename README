This project contains the basic utilities for doing sequence analyssis.  Only
C++ source codes are integrated with the autotools.  The original project
contains large fraction of perl code that will be added into the autotool
framework in future releases.

For must users, just download the *.tar.gz file and untar it.
do ./configure
make
make install
should be sufficient.

If any dependency is needed install the dependency:

  1. Orpara
  2. Bamtools (I branched the original project and added some
    interface functions)

Both are from my git hub page.
