This library is for dealing with consensus sequences. There are diffeerent kinds of 
consensus. Some rely on references others use only reference as a guide. This 
library contains consensus without using any references. The original library
was developed for generic consensus building from a family of sequences. 
This version is modified to work with amplicon sequences.  Also aded are
the graphics output. The graphics output is a simple wrapper around the 
gnu plotutils library.
